Instructions for the To-Do List Application.

The To-Do List Application utilizes a text file named tasks.txt to store and retrieve task information. Please ensure that you do not already have a file named tasks.txt unless you are okay with it being overwritten.

Run the application by pressing the "Play" button to run the program. Upon running, you will be greeted by the program and will be presented with a menu.
Enter the number 1 if you wish to add a new task item.  
Enter the number 2 if you wish to update an existing task item. This means the user may overwrite an existing task corresponding to a task number. You may add additional details, a date, or replace it with a new task entirely.  
Enter the number 3 if you wish to mark a task as completed. Doing so will keep the task in the list but it will now be shown with a green checkmark next to it.
Enter 4 if you wish to delete an existing task from the task list.  
Enter 5 if you wish to list all existing tasks that are currently in the list (including tasks marked as complete).  
Enter 6 to exit the program.  
  
Exiting the program will prompt the application to save all task information into the tasks.txt text file for it to be loaded again upon re-running the program.
